# servable

Servable is an implementation of a "simple" observable

## To install run:

```
npm i servable
// or, if you're awesome
yarn add servable
```

---------

### There a few plugins that are available - each return a new Observable instance

- [Documentation on the plugin operators can be seen here](./src/operators/DOCUMENTATION.md)

### There are also a few Observables that can be created from the Observable object itself

- [Documentation on the observables can be seen here](./src/observables/DOCUMENTATION.md)
